# Complete Local Setup

**Setup** | [Architecture](architecture.md) |
[Add a service](adding-a-service.md)

This procedure reproduces the validated stack on a Linux x86-64 machine with
an Intel GPU. The containerized path runs Hermes, the operator UI, local MCP
simulations, and OVMS through Docker Compose. The legacy host setup remains
available through `scripts/setup.sh`.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Linux with an Intel GPU render node at `/dev/dri/renderD*`.
- Git, curl, and Python 3.11 or newer. The Python venv package is preferred.
- Docker Engine with permission to run containers as the current user.
- About 8 GB free disk for the model, image, and setup environment.
- Network access to GitHub, Docker Hub, PyPI, and Hugging Face.

On Ubuntu or Debian, install host tools and Docker as follows. Log out and back
in after adding the Docker group.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl git python3 python3-venv
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh
sudo sh /tmp/get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
```

Then verify the two hardware/runtime requirements:

```bash
ls /dev/dri/renderD*
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Use the official Docker Engine instructions for non-Debian distributions. Do
not run the setup as root; the script writes Hermes state and models under the
current user's home directory.

### Proxy environments

The script honors standard proxy variables. Set these before setup when needed:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example:port
export HTTPS_PROXY="$HTTP_PROXY"
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1
export http_proxy="$HTTP_PROXY"
export https_proxy="$HTTPS_PROXY"
export no_proxy="$NO_PROXY"
```

If TLS is intercepted, configure the system or Docker daemon to trust the
organization's proxy CA; do not disable TLS verification. The image build needs
network access to the Hermes installer, SDK repository, and Python package
indexes.

## 2. Run setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel-retail/qsr-agent.git
cd qsr-agent
make up
```

Every `make up` run copies `.env.example` to `.env`, replacing any existing
`.env`. The example uses a repo-local `./models`; edit `.env.example` for remote
SAD MCP, callback URLs, or other overrides. Edits made directly to `.env` are
lost.

`make up` validates Docker, Intel render-device access, and the existing model,
then runs `docker compose up -d`. By default it pulls the pre-built image from
the registry (`REGISTRY=true`); use `make up REGISTRY=false` to build from source
instead. Override the image with `REGISTRY_URL` and `TAG` (default
`intel/qsr-agent:latest`). Download the model first with `make download-models`
(it fetches `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov` into `./models`). Useful commands:

```bash
make download-models
make logs
make status
make down
```

### Image source (pull vs build)

`make up` and `make build` select the agent image with these variables:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY` | `true` | `true` pulls the pre-built image; `false` builds from source. |
| `REGISTRY_URL` | `intel/` | Registry/namespace prefix for the image. |
| `TAG` | `latest` | Image tag. |

The image reference is `${REGISTRY_URL}qsr-agent:${TAG}` (default
`intel/qsr-agent:latest`).

```bash
make up                                            # pull the pre-built image (default)
make up REGISTRY=false                             # build from source instead
make up REGISTRY_URL=myreg.io/team/ TAG=2026.2.0   # custom registry/tag
```

Use `REGISTRY=false` until the image has been published to the registry.

The agent image installs Hermes and the MCP service dependencies at build time.
Hermes configuration/history and autonomy proposals are persisted in named
volumes. OVMS mounts `MODEL_ROOT` read-only and is available to the agent at
`http://ovms:8000/v3` inside the Compose network.

Register services in `agent-config/hermes/remote-mcp.example.yaml`, setting each
`url` to an address reachable from the QSR container. Services push their events
to `/autonomy/events` on the UI, so the service host must be able to reach the
QSR address. A loopback URL on either machine will not reach the other.

### Legacy host setup

`./scripts/setup.sh` remains available for installing Hermes and running the UI
on the host. It is idempotent and performs these operations:

1. Validates Linux, Python, Docker, and `/dev/dri` access.
2. Installs Hermes with its official installer when `hermes` is absent.
3. Installs model/YAML helpers in `.venv/qsr-setup`; when venv support is
  unavailable, it uses an isolated `.venv/qsr-setup-target` directory.
4. Downloads `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov` to `<repo>/models`.
5. Pulls the OVMS GPU image and starts `ovms-qwen3-8b` on loopback port 8000.
6. Backs up and merges `~/.hermes/config.yaml`; unrelated settings survive.
7. Registers Kiosk and Order Accuracy as local stdio MCP servers.
8. Validates OVMS, Hermes, MCP discovery, and service tests.

Validated artifact identities are pinned by default:

| Component | Identity |
|---|---|
| Hermes | v0.20.5 configuration schema 38 or a compatible newer install |
| Qwen model | `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov` revision `5c47abf4b8e12ebe8e99745bb0c1ec17e0c0abcc` |
| OVMS GPU image | `sha256:2a52cd2bc62d984f35f12b1cf58bb5dffe5f5d57b6ef3349b1b37229a768806b` |

Useful overrides:

```bash
MODEL_ROOT=/data/models OVMS_PORT=8010 ./scripts/setup.sh
HERMES_CONFIG=/data/hermes/config.yaml ./scripts/setup.sh
```

Keep the same overrides when later running `./scripts/setup.sh --check`.

### Automatic event delivery

Services push their own events to the Operator UI; there is no subscription or
callback registration. Each producer POSTs to `/autonomy/events`:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://<qsr-host>:8600/autonomy/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "alert-1",
    "event_type": "report_suspicious_activity",
    "occurred_at": "2026-10-01T15:04:05Z",
    "data": {"zone": "kitchen-prep", "severity": "critical"}
  }'
```

The producer owns delivery, filtering and retries, and should reuse a stable
`event_id` so duplicates are ignored. Events are durably queued before
assessment, so a restart does not lose them. Any event type is accepted; Hermes
decides relevance from the registered skills.

Connectivity is required from the service host to the QSR address, so a loopback
URL will not work across machines or from inside a container. On Linux, a
producer in Docker reaching a QSR UI on the same host needs:

```yaml
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```


## 3. What Hermes receives

The setup merges [the reusable settings](../agent-config/hermes/config.example.yaml)
and [local test registrations](../tests/mcp-services/hermes-mcp.example.yaml).
The essential settings are:

```yaml
model:
  default: OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov
  provider: local-ovms
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/v3
  context_length: 65536
  max_tokens: 9000
providers:
  local-ovms:
    name: Local OVMS
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/v3
    default_model: OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov
    request_timeout_seconds: 1800
    stale_timeout_seconds: 1800
tools:
  tool_search:
    enabled: false
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - /absolute/path/to/qsr-agent/qsr-skills
```

`tool_search` is intentionally disabled while the MCP catalog is small. This
passes actual MCP schemas to Qwen and avoids the deferred
`tool_search -> tool_describe -> tool_call` wrapper that caused malformed calls.
The broad built-in-tool disable used during the earlier CPU/Ollama experiment
is not required for the final OVMS/Qwen3-8B setup. No Hermes source patch is
required.

Restart an interactive Hermes process after any configuration or skill change.

## 4. Exact OVMS bring-up

The setup script runs the equivalent of this validated command:

```bash
MODEL_ROOT="$PWD/models"
MODEL_ID=OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov
RENDER_NODE=$(find /dev/dri -maxdepth 1 -name 'renderD*' -print -quit)
RENDER_GROUP=$(stat -c '%g' "$RENDER_NODE")

docker rm -f ovms-qwen3-8b 2>/dev/null || true
docker run -d --name ovms-qwen3-8b --restart unless-stopped \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -v "$MODEL_ROOT:/models" \
  --device /dev/dri \
  --group-add "$RENDER_GROUP" \
  openvino/model_server@sha256:2a52cd2bc62d984f35f12b1cf58bb5dffe5f5d57b6ef3349b1b37229a768806b \
  --rest_port 8000 \
  --model_repository_path /models \
  --source_model "$MODEL_ID" \
  --target_device GPU \
  --tool_parser hermes3 \
  --task text_generation
```

`--tool_parser hermes3` is required for OpenAI-style tool calls. Confirm model
availability with:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/v3/models
docker logs ovms-qwen3-8b
```

## 5. Run and verify

Start Hermes from the repository so it reads the project `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
cd qsr-agent
hermes
```

Reproducible one-shot questions:

```bash
hermes -z 'What is the current restaurant queue count?' --cli
hermes -z 'What is the current order accuracy rate?' --cli
```

Independent checks:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh --check
hermes mcp test kiosk
hermes mcp test order-accuracy
python3 tests/mcp-services/call_tool.py order-accuracy get_order_accuracy_context
```

The expected simulated accuracy is 87.5%: 21 accurate of 24 observed in a
30-minute window. A valid answer must come from an MCP call, not memory.

## 6. Optional containerized MCP services

This validates remote Streamable HTTP topology. It does not containerize
Hermes or OVMS:

```bash
docker build -f tests/mcp-services/Dockerfile -t qsr-mcp-service:local .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8000 \
  -e QSR_SERVICE=kiosk qsr-mcp-service:local
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8002:8000 \
  -e QSR_SERVICE=order-accuracy qsr-mcp-service:local
```

For production, put each `/mcp` endpoint behind HTTPS with bearer-token or
mTLS validation and restrict ingress to the agent host. Merge the shape in
`agent-config/hermes/remote-mcp.example.yaml` only after the endpoint passes
`hermes mcp test <name>`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `hermes` not found after install | Run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`, then open a new shell. |
| Model download fails in OVMS | Use the setup script; it downloads on the host and mounts the files. |
| OVMS cannot use GPU | Verify `/dev/dri/renderD*`, Docker permissions, and the render group passed to the container. |
| Config change appears ignored | Exit and restart the interactive Hermes process. |
| `-t order-accuracy` works but normal mode fails | Confirm `tools.tool_search.enabled` is `false` and the domain is in `platform_toolsets.cli`. |
| MCP is listed but answers are unsupported | Run `hermes mcp test`, then confirm the service observed `tools/call`. |
| `GET /mcp` returns 400 or 406 | The route exists; Streamable HTTP requires an initialized MCP session. |
| Autonomy Decisions stays empty | Confirm the producer POSTs to `/autonomy/events` and gets HTTP 202, check `GET /autonomy/status`, and verify the QSR address is reachable from the service host/container. |
| Events are rejected | `event_id`, `event_type` and an object `data` are required; a top-level `store_id` must match `QSR_RESTAURANT_ID`. |
| Same-host Docker delivery fails | Use `host.docker.internal` plus the Linux `host-gateway` mapping; `127.0.0.1` inside a container refers to that container. |
| Events predating UI startup do not appear | Delivery is forward-only. Query durable history through MCP read tools or emit a new event. |
| Python has no venv support | Setup automatically uses isolated `pip --target`; install `python3-venv` if the fallback is unavailable. |
