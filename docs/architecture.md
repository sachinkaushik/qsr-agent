# QSR Agent Architecture

[Repository overview](../README.md) | [Documentation guide](index.md) |
[Setup](setup.md) | **Architecture** |
[Add a service](adding-a-service.md)

The deployable unit is one edge-hosted agent plus independently owned domain
services. The agent runtime may later change from Hermes to another MCP-capable
framework without moving source data or business policy into the agent.

## Responsibility Boundaries

| Component | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Agent runtime | Conversation, tool registration, skill loading, cross-domain orchestration | Restaurant source data or domain authorization |
| OVMS/Qwen | Reasoning, tool selection, answer synthesis | Tool execution or trusted state |
| MCP service | Domain reads, actions, validation, policy, audit data | Cross-domain conversation policy |
| Domain skill | Question routing, field interpretation, answer and action procedure | Live values, credentials, or enforceable authorization |
| `AGENTS.md` | Stable rules spanning every domain | Detailed per-service field mappings |

## Runtime Flow

```text
User
  -> Agent loads relevant domain skill
  -> Qwen selects a direct MCP tool
  -> Agent sends tools/call over local stdio or Streamable HTTP
  -> Domain service reads or acts through its policy gate
  -> Agent returns structured result to Qwen
  -> Qwen answers using only returned evidence
```

`tools.tool_search.enabled: off` is intentional while the catalog is small. It
gives Qwen the real MCP schemas directly and removes the deferred
`tool_search -> tool_describe -> tool_call` wrapper sequence.

## Event Delivery Flow

The operator UI receives events on an HTTP endpoint. This is separate
from Hermes, which is invoked per question for conversational reads and actions.
Services deliver events by POSTing them to the UI; the UI registers nothing on
the service and the service holds no subscription state.

```text
Domain service emits an event
  -> append the standard envelope to its durable log
  -> POST the event to the QSR UI at /autonomy/events
  -> UI validates it and durably queues it
  -> a single worker evaluates queued events in FIFO order
  -> Hermes selects skills, performs MCP reads, and proposes an action
  -> browser renders the decision in the Autonomy Decisions panel
```

The browser polls `GET /autonomy/status` every five seconds to render queued,
processing and completed decisions along with any proposals awaiting approval.

For example, Suspicious Activity posts critical events of type
`report_suspicious_activity`. The service decides which events to send; the UI
accepts any event type and lets Hermes judge relevance.

Hermes evaluates each event against the registered skills and proposes an action
or records why no action applies. Hermes remains available for follow-up
investigation through the service's read tools.

Subscriptions are currently process-local. Restarting a domain MCP service
clears its registrations, so the operator UI must register again. Subscriptions
are forward-only: existing durable events are not replayed automatically.

## Remote Deployment

Use Streamable HTTP for services running on separate machines. The Dockerfile
under `tests/mcp-services/` demonstrates this topology with simulated data; it
does not run Hermes and is not a production service image. Production services
should use authoritative handlers and sit behind HTTPS plus bearer-token or
mTLS enforcement. Restrict ingress to the agent machine.

The selected agent runtime owns only endpoint configuration. For Hermes:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  service-name:
    url: https://service-name.example.internal/mcp
    transport: streamable-http
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${SERVICE_MCP_TOKEN}
    enabled: true
```

The platform scope separately controls availability in ordinary sessions:

```yaml
platform_toolsets:
  cli:
    - kiosk
    - order-accuracy
```

Do not configure both `url` and `command` for the same server. Keep the working
stdio registration until the corresponding remote endpoint passes the agent's
MCP connectivity test, then replace it atomically.

Event delivery requires connectivity in both directions:

```text
QSR machine -> service-machine /mcp
service machine -> QSR-machine /autonomy/events
```

Use routable DNS names or IP addresses for separate machines. Put both endpoints
behind TLS and authentication in production, and restrict ingress to the known
service and agent hosts.

## Service Owner Contract

Every service owner supplies these artifacts:

1. A stable MCP server name and HTTPS endpoint.
2. One broad `get_<domain>_context` read tool for general and complex questions.
3. Narrow action tools with typed inputs and policy gates.
4. JSON Schemas with units, time windows, confidence semantics, stable IDs,
   `schema_version`, `source`, and `observed_at` where applicable.
5. One domain `SKILL.md` containing question-to-tool-to-field mappings.
6. Tests for context shape, action denial/approval, and transport startup.
7. Health, audit, and tool-call logs that exclude credentials.

The broad context response should be bounded and decision-ready. Split it into
narrow reads only when payload size, latency, authorization, or update cadence
requires different handling.

## Adding a Service

Follow [adding-a-service.md](adding-a-service.md) for the complete server,
client, Hermes registration, skill, optional `AGENTS.md`, and test procedure.

## Verification Ladder

1. Unit-test the service function and policy gate without a model.
2. Start the service with `QSR_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http`.
3. Run `hermes mcp test <service>` from the Hermes machine.
4. Ask one simple and one complex domain question.
5. Confirm the service observed `tools/call` and the answer matches its result.
6. Test a denied action and an approved action separately.
7. Test a cross-domain question with one service intentionally unavailable;
   Hermes must report partial coverage instead of fabricating the missing data.
